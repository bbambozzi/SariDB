# Plans

- Make the server accept millions of concurrent connections (Virtual Threads?)
- Make the server store K-V integers.
- Make the server store K-V strings.
- Allow for server queries for K-V values
- Allow for server queries for concurrent connection amount? Maybe?
- HARD: persistance and reconstruction.
